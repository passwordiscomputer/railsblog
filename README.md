# Strengths

# About me

I am 26 years old I am not much of a writer especially when the subject is myself. I am 26 and have really been enjoying learning web development. My favorite part is the limitless ways to solve any problem. You could give 1000 programmers the same prompt and problem and you could get back 1000 different answers. I think this is really cool. At first using each new framework, language, or gem feels like stepping out into the abyss. But with a little perseverance and some creative googling it becomes clearer and clearer how to utilize this new tool. After a couple uses it's like a new tool in your toolbelt and you can combine it with other knowledge and tools to make some really cool stuff.

At first I really didn't like ruby on rails because it seemed so strict and there is so much convention. But like every other technology we've used in class it is now starting to make sense and I can see how powerful and awesome it is. There still is so much for me to learn but I'm starting to really enjoy it.

# Hobbies

* Backpacking: Is totally sweet. I've been doing it since middle school and continue to take several trips every summer. My ideal backpacking trip consists of 2-3 days of high mileage and light gear. I'm not really into taking trips longer than that but I like to book at least 15 miles a day. This summer I became a vegetarian and that presented some interesting challenges for packing food. Luckily there was a lot of great online resurces and I think I can now pack lighter more nutritious meals than ever.

* Music: I listen to a ton of music and I'm stoked that it's pretty easy to listen to tunes all day while programming.

* CLimbing: I'm kind of a bad climber but I'm working really hard to get better so I can hit up some sweet routes at smith rock this summer

* Biking: I'm a total fairweather biker but it's the best way to get around Portland without dealing with traffic and way more fun than running.

# Learning Objectives

My learning objective for the day was to learn how to use user authentication. The first time I tried to build my website I kinda screwed up and messed up my file system pretty bad. Going forward I plan to be a lot more careful and use branching to make sure I can revrt to an earlier version if I screw up on a branch instead of funking up the whole project. Also I need to become a lot better at being an efficient coder. I got too distracted and had a hard time staying focused on my code.
